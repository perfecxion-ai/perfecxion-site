                    As AI systems become deeply embedded in business operations, they are introducing new, hidden vulnerabilities
                    that traditional cybersecurity tools can't detect or defend against. From data poisoning and model theft to
                    adversarial manipulation, organizations are experiencing real-world losses — not due to system breaches, but
                    because their AI was quietly manipulated into making bad decisions and they had no idea.

                            Last year, a major bank's fraud detection system started missing obvious scams. Not all at once—but gradually,
                            almost imperceptibly. For months, the AI grew less effective at catching fraudulent transactions, and nobody
                            could figure out why.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-red-800 dark:text-red-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                            The investigation revealed something that would have seemed like science fiction a decade ago: criminals had
                            figured out how to "teach" the AI to ignore certain types of fraud. They did this by systematically feeding
                            the system carefully crafted fake transactions during its learning phase. By the time anyone noticed, the damage
                            was done—the AI had learned that certain suspicious patterns were actually normal.

                        <p className="text-red-800 dark:text-red-200 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                            This cost the bank over $50 million in undetected fraud, but the real wake-up call was simpler: their
                            state-of-the-art cybersecurity system never triggered a single alert. From a traditional security perspective,
                            nothing had been "hacked." No passwords were stolen, no systems were breached. The attack happened at a level
                            that conventional security tools simply don't monitor.

                            The AI wasn't broken—it was working exactly as it had been trained to work.

                            period. The AI learned to avoid those areas, giving the competitors a systematic advantage in delivery times.
                            The attack was so subtle that it took nearly a year to discover, and by then, the company had lost significant

                            Traditional cybersecurity is built around the idea of a fortress: strong walls, controlled gates, and clear
                            boundaries between "inside" and "outside." This works great when you're protecting static systems with

                            However, with AI this model gets thrown out the window. Your AI systems learn from massive amounts of data

                            doesn't just pass through your systems; it becomes part of them.
