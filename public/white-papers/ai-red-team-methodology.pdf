## 1. Introduction to AI Red Team Testing

### 1.1 The Evolution of Red Team Testing

Traditional red team testing focuses on network infrastructure, applications, and human factors. AI systems introduce new dimensions that require specialized testing approaches:

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: AI systems make decisions without human intervention
