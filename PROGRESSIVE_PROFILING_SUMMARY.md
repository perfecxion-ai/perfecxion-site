- **Conditional logic**: Fields appear based on previous responses
- **Auto-advancement**: Forms progress automatically when thresholds are met
- **Data persistence**: Profile data saved across sessions

### 2. Intelligent Lead Scoring
```typescript
// Example scoring breakdown
{
  demographic: 25 points,    // Company size, role, industry
  behavioral: 20 points,     // Engagement patterns
  intent: 25 points,         // AI maturity, challenges, budget
  timing: 15 points,         // Implementation timeline
  engagement: 15 points      // Download history, completion
}
```

### 3. Content Gating Strategy
- **Whitepapers**: Email + company (60% threshold)
- **Technical guides**: Email + role (40% threshold)
- **ROI calculators**: Full qualification (80% threshold)
- **Case studies**: Challenge-specific matching

### 4. Audience Segmentation
- **Developers**: Technical implementation content
- **Security Teams**: Security tools and frameworks
- **Executives**: Strategic and ROI-focused content
- **Compliance**: Regulatory and governance resources

### 5. GDPR Compliance Features
- **Automatic detection**: EU/EEA visitors via timezone/language
- **Granular consent**: 5 categories (necessary, marketing, analytics, personalization, third-party)
- **Data rights**: Export, deletion, rectification, access
- **Audit trail**: Complete consent history with IP/user agent

## üîß Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Interaction ‚Üí Field Validation ‚Üí Company Enrichment ‚Üí 
Lead Scoring ‚Üí Content Personalization ‚Üí Access Control ‚Üí

```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: Heavy components loaded on demand
- **Caching**: Company data cached for 24 hours
- **Debounced inputs**: Reduced API calls
- **Bundle optimization**: Tree-shaking and code splitting

### Security Measures
