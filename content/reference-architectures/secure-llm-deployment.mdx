# Secure LLM Deployment Reference Architecture

## Overview

This reference architecture provides a comprehensive blueprint for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in production environments with enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and compliance controls.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Security Perimeter
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- DDoS Protection
- Rate Limiting
- API Gateway with authentication

### 2. Model Serving Layer
- Load balancing across model replicas
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Model versioning and A/B testing
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

### 3. Security Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Prompt injection detection
- Output filtering for sensitive data
- Token-level access controls

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Real-time performance metrics
- Security event logging
- Model behavior analysis
- Anomaly detection

### 5. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- PII detection and masking
- Data residency controls
- Audit logging

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up secure infrastructure
2. Implement authentication and authorization
3. Deploy monitoring stack
4. Configure logging and audit trails

### Phase 2: Model Deployment
1. Deploy model serving infrastructure
2. Implement load balancing
3. Configure auto-scaling
4. Set up model versioning

### Phase 3: Security Hardening
1. Deploy security controls
2. Implement prompt filtering
3. Configure output validation
4. Enable threat detection

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Performance testing
2. Security validation
3. Compliance verification
4. Disaster recovery testing

## Security Considerations

- **Prompt Injection**: Implement multi-layer defense against prompt manipulation
- **Data Leakage**: Prevent exposure of training data or sensitive information
- **Model Theft**: Protect intellectual property through access controls
- **Supply Chain**: Verify model provenance and dependencies

## Compliance Requirements

- SOC 2 Type II controls
- GDPR data protection measures
- HIPAA safeguards (if applicable)
- Industry-specific regulations

## Monitoring Metrics

- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Token generation rate
- Error rates by category
- Security event frequency
- Resource utilization

## Cost Optimization

- Use spot instances for batch processing
- Implement request batching
- Cache common responses
- Optimize model quantization

## Conclusion

This reference architecture provides a secure, scalable foundation for LLM deployment. Adapt components based on specific requirements and threat models.
