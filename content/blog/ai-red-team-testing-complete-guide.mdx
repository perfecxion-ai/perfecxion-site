## Executive Summary

⚠️ **Critical Security Reality**

Traditional security testing methodologies fail catastrophically when applied to AI systems. Unlike conventional software where vulnerabilities are code-based, AI systems can be compromised through data, prompts, and emergent behaviors that standard pen testing cannot detect. Organizations deploying AI without specialized red team testing face an average breach cost of \$4.45M, while proactive AI red teaming costs less than 2% of that figure.


### The Paradigm Shift in Security Testing


AI introduces non-deterministic vulnerabilities that evolve with usage. Your traditional security controls are blind to 87% of AI-specific attack vectors.


👥
### Development Teams


AI red teaming must be integrated into CI/CD pipelines from day one. Post-deployment testing catches only 30% of exploitable vulnerabilities.


🗄️
### C-Suite Executives


ROI on AI red teaming averages 920%. Each vulnerability found pre-deployment saves \$125K in remediation costs and prevents potential regulatory fines.




## The Evolution: From Traditional to AI Red Teaming

Understanding why AI systems demand a fundamentally different approach to security testing is crucial for building effective defenses.
