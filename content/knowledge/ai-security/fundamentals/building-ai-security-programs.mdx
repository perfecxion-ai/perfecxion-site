# Building AI Security Programs

## Executive Summary

Establishing a comprehensive AI security program requires a strategic approach that integrates security throughout the AI lifecycle. Unlike traditional cybersecurity programs, AI security demands specialized frameworks, methodologies, and governance structures that address the unique challenges of machine learning systems.

This guide provides CISOs, security architects, and AI teams with practical frameworks for building robust AI security programs that scale with organizational growth and evolving threat landscapes.

Program Outcomes:

- Comprehensive risk management across the AI lifecycle
- Integrated security controls from development to deployment
- Measurable security posture with continuous improvement
- Regulatory compliance and audit readiness

## Practical Example: Automated AI Risk Scoring

Below is a concise Python example showing how to automate risk scoring for AI systems using the described methodology. This helps security teams quantify and prioritize risks for mitigation.

```python
def calculate_risk(probability, impact, exposure, control_effectiveness):
  # All inputs are on a 1-5 scale
  score = (probability * impact * exposure) / max(control_effectiveness, 1)
  return score

# Example risk categories
risks = [
  {"name": "data_security", "prob": 4, "impact": 5, "exposure": 3, "control": 2},
  {"name": "model_security", "prob": 3, "impact": 4, "exposure": 4, "control": 3},
  {"name": "deployment_security", "prob": 2, "impact": 3, "exposure": 2, "control": 4},
]

for risk in risks:
  score = calculate_risk(risk["prob"], risk["impact"], risk["exposure"], risk["control"])
  print(f"{risk['name']} risk score: {score:.2f}")
```

Explanation:
This code automates the risk scoring process for different AI security categories. Security teams can use this approach to prioritize risks and allocate resources for mitigation based on quantitative scores.

## Risk Assessment Methodologies

### Comprehensive AI Risk Assessment Process

#### Phase 1: Asset Discovery and Classification

AI Asset Inventory Framework:

```yaml
ai_asset_inventory:
  system_id: "ai-system-001"
  system_name: "Customer Service Chatbot"
  classification:
    criticality: "High"
    data_sensitivity: "PII"
    business_impact: "Revenue-generating"
    regulatory_scope: ["GDPR", "CCPA"]

  technical_details:
    model_type: "Large Language Model"
    frameworks: ["PyTorch", "Transformers"]
    deployment: "Cloud API"
    data_sources: ["Customer interactions", "Knowledge base"]

  security_context:
    attack_surface: "Public-facing API"
    threat_actors: ["Script kiddies", "Competitors", "Nation-state"]
    existing_controls: ["Input validation", "Rate limiting"]
```

Asset Classification Criteria:

1. **Business Criticality**

- Revenue impact if compromised
- Operational dependencies
- Customer impact potential
- Competitive advantage value

2. **Data Sensitivity**

- Personal information (PII/PHI)
- Financial data
- Intellectual property
- Classified information

3. **Regulatory Requirements**

- GDPR/CCPA compliance needs
- Industry-specific regulations
- International standards
- Audit requirements

#### Phase 2: Threat Modeling

AI-Specific Threat Modeling (STRIDE-AI)

| Category | AI-Specific Threats | Examples |

|----------|-------------------|----------|

| **Spoofing** | Model impersonation | Adversarial examples, deepfakes |

| **Tampering** | Data/model poisoning | Training data manipulation |

| **Repudiation** | Decision accountability | Unexplainable AI decisions |

| **Information Disclosure** | Model extraction | Inference attacks, data leakage |

| **Denial of Service** | Model availability | Adversarial examples, resource exhaustion |

| **Elevation of Privilege** | Unauthorized access | Prompt injection, jailbreaking |

Threat Actor Profiling:

```python
class ThreatActorProfile:
    def __init__(self, actor_type):
        self.actor_type = actor_type
        self.capabilities = self.define_capabilities()
        self.motivations = self.define_motivations()
        self.resources = self.define_resources()

    def define_capabilities(self):
        capability_matrix = {
            'script_kiddie': ['basic_tools', 'public_exploits'],
            'insider_threat': ['system_access', 'domain_knowledge'],
            'cybercriminal': ['advanced_tools', 'coordination'],
            'nation_state': ['zero_day', 'unlimited_resources']
        }
        return capability_matrix.get(self.actor_type, [])
```

#### Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment

Automated Vulnerability Scanning:

```python
class AIVulnerabilityScanner:
    def __init__(self, ai_system):
        self.system = ai_system
        self.scan_modules = [
            AdversarialRobustnessTest(),
            DataPoisoningDetector(),
            ModelExtractionTester(),
            PromptInjectionScanner(),
            PrivacyLeakageAnalyzer()
        ]

    def comprehensive_scan(self):
        results = {}
        for module in self.scan_modules:
            try:
                results[module.name] = module.scan(self.system)
            except Exception as e:
                results[module.name] = {'error': str(e)}

        return self.prioritize_vulnerabilities(results)

    def prioritize_vulnerabilities(self, results):
        # CVSS-style scoring for AI vulnerabilities
        prioritized = []
        for vuln_type, findings in results.items():
            for finding in findings:
                score = self.calculate_cvss_ai_score(finding)
                prioritized.append({
                    'type': vuln_type,
                    'finding': finding,
                    'cvss_score': score,
                    'priority': self.score_to_priority(score)
                })

        return sorted(prioritized, key=lambda x: x['cvss_score'], reverse=True)
```

## Risk Quantification Framework

AI-Specific Risk Metrics:

1. **Model Robustness Score**

- Adversarial example success rate
- Performance degradation under attack
- Recovery time from adversarial inputs

2. **Data Integrity Score**

- Training data validation results
- Anomaly detection effectiveness
- Data lineage completeness

3. **Privacy Protection Score**

- Differential privacy parameters
- Information leakage measurements
- De-identification effectiveness

4. **Operational Resilience Score**

- Uptime under attack conditions
- Incident response time
- False positive/negative rates

Risk Quantification Model:

```python
def calculate_ai_risk_score(system_metrics):
    weights = {
        'robustness': 0.25,
        'data_integrity': 0.25,
        'privacy': 0.25,
        'operational': 0.25
    }

    weighted_score = sum(
        weights[metric] * score
        for metric, score in system_metrics.items()
    )

    # Normalize to 0-100 scale
    return min(100, max(0, weighted_score * 100))
```
