## Linear Regression

### Core Concept

Linear Regression models the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) using a linear function:

```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
```

Where:
- **y**: Target variable (continuous)
- **β₀**: Intercept (bias term)
- **βᵢ**: Coefficients for each feature
- **xᵢ**: Feature values
- **ε**: Error term (residual)

### Simple Linear Regression

For a single feature, the model becomes:

```
y = β₀ + β₁x + ε
```

This represents a straight line where:
- **β₀**: y-intercept (value of y when x = 0)
- **β₁**: Slope (change in y per unit change in x)

### Multiple Linear Regression

When dealing with multiple features:

```
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
```

This creates a hyperplane in n-dimensional space.

## Logistic Regression

### Core Concept

Despite its name, Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that models the probability of belonging to a particular class:

```
P(y = 1 | x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
```

Where:
- **z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ**
- **P(y = 1 | x)**: Probability of class 1 given features x
- **e**: Euler's number (≈ 2.718)

### Binary Classification

For binary classification (two classes):

```
P(y = 1 | x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
P(y = 0 | x) = 1 - P(y = 1 | x) = e^(-z) / (1 + e^(-z))
```

### Multi-class Classification

For multiple classes, use the softmax function:

```
P(y = k | x) = e^(z_k) / Σⱼ e^(z_j)
```

Where z_k is the linear combination for class k.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

### Linear Regression: Ordinary Least Squares

The goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals:

```
min Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)²
```

Where ŷ_i = β₀ + β₁x₁ᵢ + β₂x₂ᵢ + ... + βₙxₙᵢ

#### Normal Equation Solution

For simple linear regression:
```
β₁ = Σ((x_i - x̄)(y_i - ȳ)) / Σ(x_i - x̄)²
β₀ = ȳ - β₁x̄
```

For multiple regression:
```
β = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y
```

### Logistic Regression: Maximum Likelihood

The goal is to maximize the likelihood function:

```
L(β) = Π P(y_i | x_i, β)
```

Taking the log:
```
log L(β) = Σ [y_i log(P(y_i = 1 | x_i, β)) + (1 - y_i) log(P(y_i = 0 | x_i, β))]
```

### Gradient Descent

Both algorithms can be optimized using gradient descent:

```
β_new = β_old - α * ∇L(β_old)
```

Where α is the learning rate and ∇L is the gradient of the loss function.

        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None
        
    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        
        # Initialize parameters
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0
        
        # Gradient descent
        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):
            # Forward pass
            y_pred = self.predict(X)
            
            # Compute gradients
            dw = (1/n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
            db = (1/n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)
            
            # Update parameters
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db
            
    def predict(self, X):
        return np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias

## Model Evaluation

### Linear Regression Metrics

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
```
MSE = (1/n) Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)²
```

#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
```
RMSE = √MSE
```

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
```
MAE = (1/n) Σ|y_i - ŷ_i|
```

#### R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
```
Where:
- SS_res = Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)² (residual sum of squares)
- SS_tot = Σ(y_i - ȳ)² (total sum of squares)

### Logistic Regression Metrics

#### Accuracy
```
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
```

#### Precision
```
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
```

#### Recall
```
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
```

#### F1-Score
```
F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

#### ROC-AUC
Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

## Advanced Topics

### Regularization

#### Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
Adds penalty for large coefficients:
```
min Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)² + λ Σβᵢ²
```

#### Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
Adds penalty that can zero out coefficients:
```
min Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)² + λ Σ|βᵢ|
```

#### Elastic Net
Combines both penalties:
```
min Σ(y_i - ŷ_i)² + λ₁ Σ|βᵢ| + λ₂ Σβᵢ²
```

### Feature Engineering

#### Polynomial Features
Transform features to capture non-linear relationships:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)
```

#### Interaction Terms
Create features from combinations of existing features:
```python
# Manual interaction
X['interaction'] = X['feature1'] * X['feature2']
```

#### Feature Scaling
Normalize features to similar ranges:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

# Standard scaling (z-score normalization)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Min-max scaling (0-1 normalization)
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

### Cross-Validation

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, KFold

# K-fold cross-validation
kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=kfold, scoring='accuracy')

print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean CV score: {scores.mean():.4f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.4f})")
```
