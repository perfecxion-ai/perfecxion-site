## Introduction

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) represent one of the most powerful and transformative technologies in machine learning. Inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain, these computational models have revolutionized our ability to solve complex problems in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and countless other domains.

### What Makes Neural Networks Special?

- **Universal Approximation**: Can theoretically approximate any continuous function
- **Feature Learning**: Automatically discover relevant features from raw data
- **Hierarchical Representation**: Build increasingly abstract representations layer by layer
- **End-to-End Learning**: Learn complex mappings directly from input to output

---

## Fundamental Concepts

### Biological Inspiration

Neural networks draw inspiration from the human brain's structure and function:

- **Neurons**: Basic computational units that process and transmit information
- **Synapses**: Connections between neurons that can be strengthened or weakened
- **Learning**: Adaptation of connection strengths based on experience
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple neurons working simultaneously

### Computational Model

The artificial neural network translates these biological concepts into mathematical operations:

- **Input Processing**: Receiving and weighting multiple input signals
- **Activation**: Applying non-linear transformations to produce output
- **Learning**: Adjusting weights to minimize prediction errors
- **Generalization**: Applying learned patterns to new, unseen data

---

## The Artificial Neuron

### Mathematical Foundation

The artificial neuron performs a simple but powerful computation:

```
z = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + wₙxₙ + b
y = f(z)
```

Where:
- **xᵢ**: Input values (features)
- **wᵢ**: Weight parameters (learnable)
- **b**: Bias term (learnable)
- **f()**: Activation function (non-linear)
- **y**: Output of the neuron

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling neural networks to learn complex patterns:

#### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
```
f(x) = max(0, x)
```
**Advantages**: Simple, computationally efficient, helps with vanishing gradients
**Use Case**: Most common choice for hidden layers

#### Sigmoid
```
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
```
**Advantages**: Outputs values between 0 and 1
**Use Case**: Output layer for binary classification

#### Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
```
f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
```
**Advantages**: Outputs values between -1 and 1, zero-centered
**Use Case**: Hidden layers, especially in recurrent networks

#### Softmax
```
f(xᵢ) = e^(xᵢ) / Σⱼ e^(xⱼ)
```
**Advantages**: Outputs probability distribution
**Use Case**: Output layer for multi-class classification

## Network Architecture

### Layer Organization

Neural networks organize neurons into distinct layers:

#### Input Layer
- **Purpose**: Receives raw input data
- **Size**: Matches the number of input features
- **Computation**: No computation, just data distribution

#### Hidden Layers
- **Purpose**: Learn increasingly abstract representations
- **Size**: Configurable, typically 64-1024 neurons
- **Computation**: Full neural network operations

#### Output Layer
- **Purpose**: Produces final predictions
- **Size**: Matches the task requirements
- **Computation**: Final transformation to desired output format

### Connectivity Patterns

#### Feedforward Networks
Information flows in one direction: input → hidden → output
- **Advantages**: Simple, stable, easy to train
- **Use Cases**: Classification, regression, feature extraction

#### Recurrent Networks
Information can flow in cycles, maintaining memory of previous inputs
- **Advantages**: Can process sequential data
- **Use Cases**: Natural language processing, time series analysis

#### Convolutional Networks
Specialized for processing grid-like data (images, audio)
- **Advantages**: Parameter sharing, translation invariance
- **Use Cases**: Computer vision, audio processing

## Training Neural Networks

### The Learning Process

Training a neural network involves three main steps:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute predictions for training data
2. **Loss Calculation**: Measure prediction errors
3. **Backward Pass**: Update weights to reduce errors

### Loss Functions

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
```
L = (1/n) Σ(y_pred - y_true)²
```
**Use Case**: Regression problems

#### Cross-Entropy Loss
```
L = -Σ y_true * log(y_pred)
```
**Use Case**: Classification problems

#### Binary Cross-Entropy
```
L = -[y_true * log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * log(1 - y_pred)]
```
**Use Case**: Binary classification

### Optimization Algorithms

#### Gradient Descent
```
w_new = w_old - α * ∇L(w_old)
```
Where α is the learning rate

#### Adam Optimizer
Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates:
```
m = β₁ * m + (1 - β₁) * ∇L
v = β₂ * v + (1 - β₂) * (∇L)²
w = w - α * m / (√v + ε)
```

#### RMSprop
Adaptive learning rate based on moving average of squared gradients:
```
v = β * v + (1 - β) * (∇L)²
w = w - α * ∇L / (√v + ε)
```

## Deep Learning Architectures

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are specialized for processing grid-like data:

#### Convolutional Layer
```
(f * I)(i,j) = Σₘ Σₙ f(m,n) * I(i+m, j+n)
```
Where f is the filter/kernel and I is the input

#### Pooling Layer
Reduces spatial dimensions while preserving important features:
- **Max Pooling**: Takes maximum value in each window
- **Average Pooling**: Takes average value in each window

#### Architecture Example
```
Input (32x32x3) → Conv (28x28x32) → Pool (14x14x32) → Conv (10x10x64) → Pool (5x5x64) → Dense (100) → Output (10)
```

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs process sequential data by maintaining hidden state:

#### Simple RNN
```
h_t = tanh(W_h * h_{t-1} + W_x * x_t + b_h)
y_t = W_y * h_t + b_y
```

#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Addresses vanishing gradient problem with gating mechanisms:
```
f_t = σ(W_f * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)  # Forget gate
i_t = σ(W_i * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)  # Input gate
C̃_t = tanh(W_C * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)  # Candidate values
C_t = f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * C̃_t  # Cell state
o_t = σ(W_o * [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)  # Output gate
h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)  # Hidden state
```

### Transformer Networks

Modern architecture using attention mechanisms:

#### Self-Attention
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```
Where Q, K, V are query, key, and value matrices

#### Multi-Head Attention
```
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O
head_i = Attention(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
```

    model.train()
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for inputs, labels in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            running_loss += loss.item()
        
        if (epoch + 1) % 10 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')

        layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    model.compile(
        optimizer='adam',
        loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )
    
    return model

# Model training

history = model.fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    batch_size=32,
    epochs=10,
    validation_split=0.2
)
```
