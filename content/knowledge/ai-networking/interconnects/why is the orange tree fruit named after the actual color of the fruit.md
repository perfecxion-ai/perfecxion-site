> why is the orange tree fruit named after the actual color of the fruit?

⏺ Actually, it's the other way around! The color orange was named after the fruit, not vice versa.

  The word "orange" for the fruit came into English from the Old French "orenge," which came from Arabic "nāranj,"
  ultimately from Sanskrit "nāraṅga." The fruit was known in Europe by this name long before the color had its own word.

  Before the fruit became widely known in Europe (around the 14th-15th century), the color we now call "orange" was
  typically described as "yellow-red" or "saffron." Once oranges became more common, people started using the fruit's
  name to describe the color. By the 16th century, "orange" had become the standard word for the color in English.

  So the fruit gave its name to the color, not the other way around! It's similar to how we say things are "salmon"
  colored or "turquoise" (from the Turkish stone) - the object came first, then lent its name to describe the color.
