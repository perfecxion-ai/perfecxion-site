# Security Risks in Shared AI Fabrics: Congestion Control and Telemetry Vulnerabilities

## Executive Summary

Your shared AI fabric faces serious vulnerabilities through its congestion control and telemetry systems. AI workloads need high-performance, lossless networking for distributed training and inference. The protocols that optimize performance—RoCEv2 congestion control, InfiniBand adaptive routing, and fabric telemetry—create exploitable attack surfaces. Attackers exploit these systems for tenant-to-tenant congestion manipulation. They poison telemetry data. They create timing side-channels and launch denial-of-service attacks. Your AI training jobs fail or take far longer to complete. System reliability drops.

## Congestion Control Protocol Vulnerabilities

### RoCEv2 Congestion Control Exploitation

RoCEv2 depends on Priority Flow Control (PFC) and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) through the DCQCN algorithm. Multi-tenant environments face multiple attack vectors. The lossless nature essential for AI workloads introduces critical vulnerabilities:

**PFC Vulnerability Chains**: Attackers trigger cascading pause frames that propagate upstream. Head-of-line blocking affects victim flows. Aggressive elephant flows consume bandwidth while mice flows starve—a "parking lot problem" enabling congestion-based service denial against competing tenants.

**ECN Manipulation**: DCQCN's dependency on ECN marking allows false congestion signaling. Malicious tenants craft traffic patterns triggering premature ECN marking. Legitimate flows reduce transmission rates unnecessarily. Uncontrolled bursts overwhelm buffers despite congestion signals, especially with misconfigured ECN thresholds.

**Buffer Exhaustion Attacks**: Shared buffer architectures in multi-tenant fabrics become targets for deliberate flooding. Attackers generate bursty traffic designed to exhaust switch buffers. Other tenants experience packet drops even in "lossless" configurations.

### InfiniBand Adaptive Routing Weaknesses

InfiniBand's adaptive routing improves load distribution but introduces path prediction and traffic analysis vulnerabilities:

**Routing Table Poisoning**: InfiniBand's distributed adaptive routing lets malicious nodes influence routing decisions through crafted congestion reports. Attackers force traffic onto suboptimal paths and create artificial bottlenecks that benefit their own flows.

**Congestion Spreading**: Localized congestion artificially propagates to unrelated network segments, an amplification attack. When deliberately triggered, the "reverse parking lot problem" disrupts legitimate traffic patterns.

**DoS Through Routing Manipulation**: InfiniBand networks suffer from coordinated campaigns exploiting routing vulnerabilities across multiple switches. Network-wide disruption follows. Case studies document attacks spreading across organizations, with damages exceeding $100,000.

## Telemetry Mechanism Security Risks

### In-Band Network Telemetry (INT) Vulnerabilities

In-band telemetry provides network visibility but creates data leakage and expands attack surfaces:

**Telemetry Data Interception**: Traditional INT systems transmit telemetry in plaintext. Man-in-the-middle attacks succeed. Trojan horses inject false data. Attackers intercept queue depths, transit delays, and traffic patterns. They perform inference attacks on your AI workload characteristics.

**INT Packet Manipulation**: Four primary INT manipulation attacks exploit the framework's weaknesses. Malicious actors craft adversarial INT packets with minimal effort. False telemetry information causes severe network disruption.

**Metadata Leakage**: Extended metadata capabilities (like CXL 3.1's 34-bit metadata) provide rich diagnostic information. This inadvertently exposes sensitive AI training patterns, model architectures, and data flow characteristics.

### sFlow and Network Monitoring Exploitation

sFlow and traditional telemetry create covert channels and side-channel vulnerabilities:

**Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Monitoring systems sampling network flows reveal sensitive information about AI workloads. Model training phases become visible. Gradient exchange patterns emerge. Parameter server communications expose themselves. This intelligence enables targeted attacks on specific training jobs.

**Telemetry Poisoning**: Advanced attackers inject false analytics data—"poisoned telemetry"—into monitoring systems. AIOps tools perform harmful automated actions based on deception. Research shows 89.2% success rates in manipulating AIOps agents through crafted log entries.

## Attack Surface Analysis in AI Fabrics

### Tenant-to-Tenant Congestion Attacks

Multi-tenant AI fabrics suffer sophisticated inter-tenant attacks exploiting shared infrastructure:

**Gradient Exchange Targeting**: Distributed AI training relies heavily on all-reduce collective operations for gradient synchronization. Predictable traffic patterns emerge. Malicious tenants launch precisely timed congestion attacks during critical gradient exchange phases. Training iteration times increase significantly.

**Parameter Server Traffic Manipulation**: Attackers identify high-frequency parameter pulls and pushes in parameter server architectures. Congestion attacks create artificial bottlenecks. Model convergence rates suffer disproportionately.

**Timing Side-Channel Exploitation**: AI workload timing creates exploitable side channels. Network congestion measurements reveal model architecture details. Training progress becomes visible. Even input data characteristics emerge through timing analysis.

### Covert Channel Creation

Congestion control mechanisms enable sophisticated covert channels:

**Congestion-Based Signaling**: Malicious tenants encode information in deliberate congestion patterns. PFC pause frame timing carries messages. ECN marking frequencies establish covert communication channels bypassing traditional network monitoring.

**Queue Depth Modulation**: Attackers control traffic injection rates to modulate switch queue depths in predictable patterns. A covert channel emerges, observable through telemetry systems.

## AI Workload-Specific Vulnerabilities

### Large Model Training Sensitivity

Modern AI training shows extreme sensitivity to network performance variations:

**Collective Communication Disruption**: Large language models with hundreds of billions of parameters generate massive gradient exchange traffic. Minor congestion attacks during all-reduce operations cause training job failures. Completion times extend significantly. Thousands of GPU-hours waste away.

**Memory Bandwidth Attacks**: AI workloads using CXL memory expansion face new attack vectors through interconnect congestion. Attackers target cache-coherent memory traffic, and artificial memory bandwidth limitations disrupt model training.

### Inference Service Targeting

AI inference services face unique performance-sensitive attacks:

**Latency Injection**: Inference workloads requiring sub-millisecond response times become vulnerable to subtle congestion attacks. Just enough delay violates SLA requirements without triggering obvious alarms.

**Batch Processing Disruption**: Attackers time congestion attacks to coincide with inference batch processing windows. Impact on throughput and service availability is maximized.

## Defense Mechanisms and Countermeasures

### Authenticated Telemetry Systems

**SecPro-INT** and similar frameworks provide dynamic encryption switching based on network conditions. These systems balance security with performance. "Security level + performance loss" feedback mechanisms adjust encryption strength in real-time.

**Blockchain-based Telemetry Protection**: The SINT (Secure INT) architecture uses lightweight blockchain consensus to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. The system achieves 97% bandwidth use while maintaining security through distributed validation of network measurements.

### Advanced Congestion Control Defenses

**AI-Enhanced Congestion Detection**: Machine learning models identify anomalous congestion patterns. These systems distinguish legitimate traffic bursts from malicious congestion attacks with high accuracy.

**QoS Isolation Mechanisms**: Tenant isolation through dedicated QoS queues prevents cross-tenant congestion attacks. Cisco's AI/ML blueprint recommends strict traffic segregation. Per-tenant buffer allocation and ECN marking policies provide protection.

### Rate Limiting and Anomaly Detection

**Intelligent Rate Limiting**: Token Bucket and Sliding Window approaches provide burst-tolerant protection against congestion attacks. Systems adapt dynamically to legitimate AI traffic patterns while blocking malicious flows.

**Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Network anomaly detection for AI traffic patterns identifies attacks within 30 seconds. Sub-5% false positive rates are achievable. Statistical methods combined with machine learning distinguish normal AI workload variations from attacks.

## Security Model Limitations and Open Challenges

### Scalability vs. Security Trade-offs

Current security models face fundamental scalability challenges as AI fabrics evolve toward 400G/800G Ethernet and beyond:

**Hardware Acceleration Requirements**: MACsec on 400G links needs specialized hardware acceleration. Microsecond-level latency bounds essential for AI workloads must be maintained. Security overhead versus performance trade-offs become increasingly critical at higher speeds.

**Quantum-Safe Evolution**: Post-quantum cryptography requirements for high-speed fabrics introduce complexity and potential performance impacts. Current security models don't adequately address these challenges.

### Cross-Domain Attack Complexity

**Multi-Layer Attack Scenarios**: Modern attacks combine telemetry poisoning with congestion manipulation. Cross-category vulnerabilities emerge that existing defenses fail to address. Poisoned telemetry masks congestion attacks. Congestion amplifies telemetry injection success rates.

**Emerging Interconnect Challenges**: CXL and NVLink security models remain insufficient against sophisticated timing attacks and memory coherence exploitation. New attack vectors emerge through cache-coherent memory access patterns, and traditional network security approaches can't address these threats.

## Future Research Directions

### Zero-Trust AI Fabric Architecture

Comprehensive zero-trust models for AI fabrics require continuous verification of all network participants. Dynamic security policy adjustment based on workload characteristics becomes essential.

### AI-Driven Defense Evolution

Self-healing networks using AI-powered anomaly detection represent next-generation defense. Real-time threat identification and automated response must minimize false positives that disrupt legitimate AI training.

### Secure-by-Design Interconnects

Future interconnect standards must incorporate hardware-level security from the ground up—authenticated congestion signaling, encrypted telemetry channels, and tamper-resistant buffer management become requirements.

## Practical Example: Simulating Congestion Attack Impact on AI Training Iteration Time

Below is a Python code example that models the effect of a targeted congestion attack during gradient exchange phases on AI training iteration time. The code visualizes how attack timing can increase iteration duration and overall job completion time.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def simulate_iteration_times(base_time_ms, attack_time_ms, attack_frequency, num_iterations):
    """
    Simulate AI training iteration times under periodic congestion attacks.
    Args:
        base_time_ms: Baseline iteration time in milliseconds
        attack_time_ms: Iteration time during attack
        attack_frequency: Every N iterations, an attack occurs
        num_iterations: Total number of iterations
    Returns:
        List of iteration times
    """
    times = []
    for i in range(num_iterations):
        if i % attack_frequency == 0:
            times.append(attack_time_ms)
        else:
            times.append(base_time_ms)
    return times

# Example usage
BASE_TIME = 100  # ms
ATTACK_TIME = 300  # ms
ATTACK_FREQ = 10  # every 10th iteration
NUM_ITER = 100
iteration_times = simulate_iteration_times(BASE_TIME, ATTACK_TIME, ATTACK_FREQ, NUM_ITER)

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
plt.plot(range(NUM_ITER), iteration_times, marker='o', linestyle='-', label='Iteration Time (ms)')
plt.xlabel('Iteration')
plt.ylabel('Iteration Time (ms)')
plt.title('Impact of Targeted Congestion Attack on AI Training Iteration Time')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(f"Total Training Time: {sum(iteration_times)/1000:.2f} seconds")
```

**Commentary:**
- This code models how periodic congestion attacks during critical gradient exchange phases can increase iteration time and total training duration for distributed AI jobs.
- You can adjust `BASE_TIME`, `ATTACK_TIME`, `ATTACK_FREQ`, and `NUM_ITER` to match your workload and attack scenario.
- The visualization helps communicate the operational risk of congestion manipulation in multi-tenant AI fabrics.

## Conclusion

Security challenges in shared AI fabrics represent a critical intersection of high-performance networking and cybersecurity, demanding immediate attention. AI workloads become central to your operations. Exploitation of congestion control and telemetry mechanisms threatens both performance and confidentiality. The cross-category nature of these vulnerabilities creates compound risks. Telemetry leaks amplify congestion attacks, and defensive measures create new attack surfaces. You need holistic security approaches beyond traditional network protection models. Your organization must implement multi-layered defense strategies. Combine authenticated telemetry with intelligent anomaly detection. Add robust tenant isolation and hardware-accelerated security features. Yet fundamental trade-offs between performance and security persist in high-speed AI fabrics, and attack techniques evolve rapidly.

Continued research into secure-by-design networking architectures optimized for AI workloads becomes urgent. The future of secure AI infrastructure depends on proactive security integration at every layer. Hardware-level protections in emerging interconnects must work with application-aware network security policies. These policies must understand the unique characteristics of AI training and inference workloads.
