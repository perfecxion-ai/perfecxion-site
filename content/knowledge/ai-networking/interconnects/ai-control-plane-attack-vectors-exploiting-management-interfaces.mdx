# AI Control Plane Attack Vectors: Exploiting Management Interfaces

## Executive Summary

Your modern AI networking fabric contains critical vulnerabilities in its congestion control mechanisms. Multi-tenant GPU clusters face specific threats. The pursuit of ultra-low latency and lossless performance through RoCEv2 protocol created a new attack surface. Priority Flow Control (PFC), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), and Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN) protocols manage congestion—and introduce vulnerabilities.

The primary attack vectors aren't theoretical. PFC pause frame storms, ECN bit manipulation, and DCQCN feedback loop exploitation work in practice. Academic research from premier security conferences demonstrates these exploits. Attacks range from catastrophic, fabric-wide Denial of Service to subtle performance degradation. In commercial multi-tenant environments, these vulnerabilities enable unfair resource allocation. A malicious tenant monopolizes network bandwidth at others' expense.

These findings demand evolution in your security model. Multi-tenant AI clusters need more than traditional network and hypervisor isolation. Security must account for performance isolation at the RDMA-capable Network Interface Card (RNIC) level and its congestion control logic. This report deconstructs the technologies, analyzes each attack vector with supporting research, contextualizes threats in multi-tenant frameworks, and evaluates current and future mitigation strategies.

## Deconstructing the AI Fabric: The Interplay of Performance and Vulnerability

You need to understand the components of an "AI Fabric" and its performance-driven design choices to comprehend the security vulnerabilities in modern high-performance networks.

### Clarifying the AI Fabric: From Software Abstraction to High-Performance Interconnect

"AI Fabric" carries ambiguity. Some contexts refer to software-defined data architecture layers using knowledge graphs to unify data sources for AI workloads. This data-centric view is valid, but network security analysis requires technical precision.

In large-scale AI infrastructure, your "AI Fabric" is the physical and logical network interconnect linking hundreds or thousands of GPU-accelerated compute nodes. These fabrics handle unique communication patterns of distributed AI training—synchronous, intense, all-to-all data exchanges among GPUs. AI fabrics use non-blocking, multi-stage Clos topologies. They provide high, predictable bandwidth with minimal latency between any two endpoints. This high-performance interconnect, increasingly built on open Ethernet standards, forms the foundation for AI workloads and focuses this security analysis.

### The RoCEv2 Protocol Stack: The Foundation for Low-Latency Communication

Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enables your AI fabric's performance. RDMA lets one computer access another's memory directly, bypassing both operating system kernels. This kernel bypass dramatically reduces latency and CPU overhead—critical for tightly coupled AI training jobs.

RDMA originated in specialized networks like InfiniBand. RoCEv2 transports RDMA over standard, routable Ethernet and IP networks, making it the de facto standard for open, high-performance AI fabrics. RoCEv2 encapsulates InfiniBand transport protocol within UDP and IP headers. It uses UDP destination port 4791. A critical requirement: while UDP is connectionless, the network must not reorder packets in the same flow. RDMA transport layer depends on in-order packet delivery.

Your AI fabric's entire architecture strips away traditional TCP/IP stack overhead through cascading optimizations. This design philosophy creates profound security implications. Critical control logic shifts from the host operating system kernel—well-understood and secured—to RNIC firmware. This migration creates a new, less-scrutinized attack surface. Unprivileged user-space applications can potentially interact with and manipulate low-level network control functions.

### The Delicate Balance of Lossless Networking: An Overview of PFC, ECN, and DCQCN

RDMA protocols can't tolerate packet loss. A single dropped packet stalls operations and triggers costly recovery. RoCEv2 requires a "lossless" or "drop-free" network fabric. Three key congestion management mechanisms achieve this.

#### Priority Flow Control (PFC): The Double-Edged Sword of Losslessness

RoCEv2 fabrics use Priority-based Flow Control (PFC), specified in IEEE 802.1Qbb, to prevent packet drops from buffer overflows. Unlike older IEEE 802.3x Ethernet PAUSE that halts all traffic, PFC operates on individual traffic priorities. When a switch's buffer for a specific priority queue exceeds a threshold, it sends a PFC PAUSE frame upstream. This instructs the neighbor to stop sending that specific priority's traffic briefly. This link-level, hop-by-hop back-pressure prevents congestion-related packet drops.

#### Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN): The Early Warning System

PFC prevents packet loss but creates inefficiencies when used alone—traffic stalls emerge. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), defined in RFC 3168, provides proactive congestion signaling. Network switches signal incipient congestion before buffers fill and PFC pauses become necessary.

ECN uses two bits in the IP header's DiffServ field, creating four codepoints: 00 for Not-ECT, 01 and 10 for ECT, and 11 for CE (Congestion Experienced). When an ECT packet arrives at a filling queue, the switch changes the codepoint to CE instead of dropping. This CE mark signals end-to-end that congestion builds along the path.

#### Data Center Quantized Congestion Notification (DCQCN): The Integrated Control Loop

DCQCN integrates ECN and PFC to manage RoCEv2 traffic effectively. It reacts to ECN's early warnings to avoid triggering disruptive PFC mechanisms.

DCQCN operates through a three-part feedback loop:

**Congestion Point (CP)**: The network switch marks ECN-capable packets with CE when its egress queue exceeds configured thresholds.

**Notification Point (NP)**: The receiving host's RNIC generates a Congestion Notification Packet (CNP) upon receiving CE-marked packets.

**Reaction Point (RP)**: The sending host's RNIC reduces its injection rate for the connection when receiving CNPs.

This closed-loop system lets senders dynamically throttle transmission rates responding to real-time congestion. High throughput continues while queue depths stay low, minimizing PFC pause needs. Yet this interdependency creates cascading vulnerabilities. Attacks circumventing DCQCN force fallback to cruder PFC mechanisms, increasing susceptibility to catastrophic failures like pause storms and deadlocks.

## Attack Vector Analysis I: Weaponizing Flow Control with PFC Storms

PFC creates lossless fabrics but harbors significant vulnerability. Under certain conditions, its back-pressure signaling propagates uncontrollably. A "PFC storm" paralyzes your entire network fabric—a direct, severe Denial of Service vector.

### Mechanism of a PFC Storm: From a Single Fault to Fabric-Wide Paralysis

A single malfunctioning end-host NIC typically causes PFC storms. When a NIC's receive pipeline stalls—from hardware faults, driver bugs, or other issues—it stops processing packets. Its internal receive buffer fills rapidly. The NIC transmits continuous PFC PAUSE frames to its connected Top-of-Rack switch to prevent packet loss.

Cascading failure propagates through your network:

1. The ToR switch honors PAUSE frames and stops transmitting to the faulty NIC
2. The ToR's egress buffers fill with packets from other network sources
3. Back-pressure triggers the ToR to send PFC PAUSE frames upstream
4. The process repeats hop-by-hop through spine switches, leaf switches, other ToRs, and finally all sending servers

Result: fabric-wide gridlock. No traffic in the lossless priority class transmits. Total DoS affects all fabric tenants.

### The Role of Head-of-Line Blocking in Cascading Failures

Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking exacerbates PFC storm propagation. HOL blocking occurs when a blocked packet at queue front prevents all subsequent packets from processing, even with clear destinations.

PFC operates per-priority, but all traffic flows sharing that priority typically use the same switch port queue. When PFC pauses that priority due to single-destination congestion (the faulty NIC), it blocks all flows in that priority class. "Innocent" flows destined for non-congested ports suffer collateral damage. This vulnerability is critical in multi-tenant environments where unrelated tenant traffic multiplexes onto the same physical links and shares priority classes.

### Impact Analysis: A Deterministic Path to Denial of Service in Multi-Tenant Clusters

PFC storms create complete, fabric-wide DoS affecting all tenants, not just the one with the initial fault. Localized device failure becomes global network outage.

Research discusses PFC storms as hardware or software fault outcomes, but the mechanism is deterministic. In multi-tenant environments with untrusted tenants, malicious actors can intentionally trigger this condition. Exploiting NIC driver or firmware vulnerabilities, or crafting workloads that overwhelm NIC receive pipelines, tenants could induce states mimicking hardware failure. This launches potent, difficult-to-attribute DoS attacks against entire clusters. The network's response—cascading pause—remains identical whether triggers are accidental or deliberate. This blurs reliability issues with security threats. A fundamental trade-off emerges: mechanisms preventing minor packet loss introduce risks of major network availability loss.

### Case Studies and Prior Research on PFC-Induced Deadlocks and Storms

PFC-induced failures aren't theoretical. Research and operational experience from large cloud providers confirm PFC leads to network deadlocks in production. Deadlocks occur through Cyclic Buffer Dependencies (CBD), where paused queue cycles form preventing any device transmission—permanently halting traffic. PFC storms are severe, widespread back-pressure manifestations. Deadlock avoidance strategies using routing restrictions exist but remain complex and imperfect. Robust detection and mitigation become necessary safeguards.

## Attack Vector Analysis II: ECN Bit Manipulation for Covert Degradation

Beyond PFC storm brute-force DoS, subtle attacks manipulate Explicit Congestion Notification. Forging congestion signals tricks victim senders into unnecessary throttling, causing severe performance degradation and unfair resource allocation.

### The ECN Feedback Mechanism in RoCEv2

DCQCN in RoCEv2 uses ECN as primary congestion signaling. Switches mark packet IP headers with CE codepoint (11) indicating congestion. Receivers detect marks and send CNPs back to senders, which reduce rates. This feedback loop assumes CE marks are trustworthy signals from network elements.

### Theoretical Exploits: Forging Congestion for Throughput Suppression

ECN manipulation attacks subvert this trust model. Malicious tenants inject spoofed IP packets destined for victim tenant receivers. These forged packets arrive with ECN bits already set to CE (11).

Victim receivers can't distinguish legitimate switch CE marks from malicious sender forgeries. They behave correctly per DCQCN: generating and sending CNPs to victim senders. Victim senders receiving floods of apparent legitimate CNPs conclude heavy network congestion exists. They drastically reduce transmission rates. This suppresses victim throughput, causing significant performance degradation or targeted DoS.

### Lessons from TCP: Applying Historical Congestion Control Attacks to Modern Fabrics

This attack directly parallels vulnerabilities identified in TCP's ECN implementation decades ago. Early RFC 3168 security analyses showed attackers could spoof TCP segments with CE bits to force legitimate senders to halve congestion windows unnecessarily, degrading performance.

The fundamental vulnerability remains identical in legacy TCP and modern RoCEv2: congestion signals travel in unauthenticated IP headers. Any entity sending packets to receivers can trigger feedback mechanisms. ECN protocol assumed cooperative Internet models where only routers set CE bits. This model fails in adversarial multi-tenant data centers where malicious tenants internal to fabrics forge signals at will. This attack represents a Type of Service flood—attackers falsify TOS fields containing ECN bits to degrade victim connections. RDMA research explicitly demonstrates forging congestion notification packets for such attacks.

### Impact Analysis: Inducing Performance Degradation and Jitter

Unlike widespread, obvious PFC storm outages, ECN manipulation creates subtle, targeted attacks. Primary impact: severe performance degradation for specific tenants, applications, or flows. This creates profound unfairness—malicious tenants selectively suppress competitor workloads, allowing their flows to consume freed bandwidth.

Attacks introduce significant network jitter. Victim sending rates oscillate responding to false, erratic congestion signals. Synchronous, tightly coupled AI training depending on lockstep GPU communication suffers particularly. Induced jitter potentially slows entire training jobs to throttled node pace. In public clouds with metered GPU time, this attack enables covert economic warfare. Malicious tenants degrade competitor performance, increasing job completion times and cloud computing bills.

## Attack Vector Analysis III: Sophisticated Exploitation of the DCQCN Feedback Loop

The most sophisticated attacks target DCQCN protocol logic, exploiting design choices for resource monopolization. These "performance hacking" attacks manipulate stateful RNIC resource management beyond simple packet forgery.

### The Anatomy of a DCQCN Feedback Loop: CP, NP, RP, and the CNP Packet

DCQCN's feedback loop uses Congestion Notification Packets (CNPs) as explicit messages from receivers (NP) to senders (RP) signaling congestion. CNP reception directly triggers sender injection rate reduction. CNPs become high-value manipulation targets.

### Exploit A: Forging Congestion Notification Packets for Targeted Throttling

This attack directly and potently extends ECN bit manipulation. Instead of indirectly triggering victim receivers to generate CNPs, malicious actors forge and send CNPs directly to victim senders.

"NeVerMore: Exploiting RDMA Mistakes in NVMe-oF Storage Applications" provides proof-of-concept for this "Fake Congestion" attack. Privileged users forge RoCEv2 CNPs knowing only victim connection identifiers (Queue Pair Numbers). Victim RNICs receiving forged CNPs drastically slow transmission rates. The core vulnerability: complete lack of CNP cryptographic authentication. Sender RNICs can't verify legitimate CNPs genuinely triggered by CE-marked packets at intended receivers. This enables highly effective, targeted DoS or performance degradation through direct sender rate-limiting manipulation.

### Exploit B: Parallel and Staggered Queue Pair Attacks for Unfair Bandwidth Allocation

These attacks escalate significantly, exploiting fundamental RDMA congestion control design decisions for unfair, disproportionate bandwidth shares.

Two-part vulnerability: First, RDMA congestion control (including DCQCN) enforces per-connection, with Queue Pairs (QPs) as endpoints. Second, optimizing for short "mice flows," new QPs begin transmitting at full line rate, reducing only after receiving congestion feedback. This performance optimization for one workload type creates critical security flaws for others. AI training jobs dominated by long-lived "elephant flows" make this design pure vulnerability in AI fabric contexts.

Zhu et al. demonstrate in "RDMA Congestion Control: It's Only for the Compliant":

**Parallel QP Attack**: Malicious tenants open multiple QPs to the same destination simultaneously instead of using single QPs for large transfers. Network congestion control allocates bandwidth per-QP. Attackers unfairly capture bottleneck link shares proportional to QP numbers, starving well-behaved single-QP tenants.

**Staggered QP Attack**: Attackers effectively ignore congestion control. Continuously opening new QPs and sending data round-robin across them. New QPs start at line rate, throttling only after one network RTT of congestion feedback. Attackers send full RTT data at line rate on one QP, then switch to new, un-throttled QPs before feedback arrives. Cycling through new QPs maintains near-line-rate throughput, completely circumventing DCQCN.

### Impact Analysis: Achieving Resource Monopolization and Starving Co-located Tenants

"Performance hacking" attacks severely break fairness and performance isolation. Malicious tenants effectively monopolize network resources, starving co-located tenants of fair bandwidth shares. Testbed experiments show attackers using these techniques claim 72% of available bandwidth from single well-behaved victim flows. By ignoring congestion control, attacker traffic fills switch buffers, increasing 99.9th percentile tail latency for other tenant short flows seven-fold. The attack surface extends beyond wire protocols to resource abstraction models—attacks leverage user-space APIs for creating network resources (QPs) achieving unfair data-plane outcomes.

## Table 1: Comparison of Congestion Control Attack Vectors

| Attack Vector | Mechanism | Primary Impact | Affected Component(s) | Key Research Citations |

|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|

| PFC Storm | Malfunctioning NIC sends continuous PFC PAUSE frames, causing fabric-wide back-pressure via HOL blocking | Fabric-wide DoS | All Ethernet switches and fabric tenants | |

| ECN Bit Forgery | Attacker injects spoofed IP packets with pre-set CE bit, tricking victim receiver into sending CNPs | Targeted Performance Degradation, Unfairness, Jitter | Victim sender/receiver pair; sender's RNIC throttled | |

| CNP Forgery | Attacker forges and sends unauthenticated CNPs directly to victim sender | Targeted DoS or Performance Degradation | Victim sender's RNIC directly throttled | |

| Parallel/Staggered QP | Attacker exploits per-QP rate limiting and line-rate start by opening many QPs or cycling through new ones | Unfair Bandwidth Allocation, Resource Monopolization, Increased Tail Latency | All tenants sharing bottleneck link with attacker | |

## The Multi-Tenant Battlefield: Performance Isolation and Resource Fairness

Multi-tenant environments magnify these vulnerabilities. Motivations for exploitation—competitive advantage, resource monopolization, or disruption—peak here. Securing such environments requires threat models extending beyond traditional isolation boundaries.

### "Hard" vs. "Soft" Multi-Tenancy: Defining the Threat Model

Multi-tenancy in GPU clusters shares expensive compute and network resources among multiple users to reduce costs and improve use. Sharing categorizes by tenant trust relationships:

**Soft Multi-Tenancy**: Generally trusted tenants, like different organizational teams. Isolation primarily manages resources and prevents accidental interference.

**Hard Multi-Tenancy**: Untrusted tenants, like different public cloud customers. Isolation must be cryptographically and logically strong defending against malicious actors attacking other tenants or infrastructure.

For hard multi-tenancy, congestion control attacks aren't just operational risks but credible security threats. Malicious tenants have means (fabric access) and motive (disrupting competitors) to launch attacks.

### The "Noisy Neighbor" Problem Reimagined: Congestion Control as the Attack Vector

Cloud computing's classic "noisy neighbor" problem—one tenant's high resource consumption negatively impacts others sharing hardware—takes adversarial form through RoCEv2 congestion control vulnerabilities. Tenants no longer need legitimate vast resource consumption to be "noisy." They become actively "malicious" exploiting control protocols to amplify impact and unfairly steal resources. Parallel and Staggered QP attacks weaponize noisy neighbors—attackers manipulate congestion control creating noise and monopolizing bandwidth beyond fair shares. Performance isolation failure becomes security breach—one tenant actively violates another's resource boundaries.

### Why Traditional QoS is Insufficient: The Challenge of Microarchitectural Resource Isolation in RDMA NICs

Traditional network QoS—packet classification, marking, and switch queuing policies—can't mitigate these advanced threats. While proper QoS configuration segments traffic, it doesn't address end-host RNIC control loop vulnerabilities.

Recent research shows current RDMA performance isolation overlooks complex, hidden RNIC microarchitectural resources. Malicious tenants exploit shared internal resources (QP state machines, memory buffers) degrading other tenant performance. QP-based attacks perfectly illustrate this—exploiting logical resources (QPs) invisible to and unmanageable by traditional switch-based QoS. Security enforcement and trust boundaries must push back from network switch ports into server chassis, potentially to PCIe bus levels where RNICs connect to hosts.

## Mitigation Strategies and Architectural Recommendations

Addressing sophisticated AI fabric congestion control attack vectors requires multi-layered defense combining reactive mechanisms, proactive protocol enhancements, and novel architectural solutions.

### Reactive Defenses: The Role and Limitations of PFC Watchdogs

Network equipment vendors implement "PFC watchdogs" combating PFC storm threats. This monitors PFC-enabled switch port queues. Detecting queues paused by continuous PFC frames for abnormal periods (hundreds of milliseconds) indicates storms or deadlocks.

Watchdog mitigation typically disables PFC on stalled queues and drops packets destined there. This breaks back-pressure cycles, allowing fabric operation resumption. However, this last-resort measure prevents fabric-wide DoS by sacrificing "lossless" guarantees for affected ports—creating lossy links. PFC watchdogs provide crucial reactive defense treating symptoms (storms) not root causes of faults or malicious triggers.

### Proactive Defenses: Towards Authenticated Congestion Feedback and Secure Control Packets

ECN and CNP forgery attacks share one root cause: lacking authentication for congestion signals and feedback packets. Robust, proactive defense requires securing control plane communication.

Theoretically, secure transports like IPsec could provide cryptographic integrity and authentication for all packets including CNPs. However, research suggests complications—RoCEv2's connection identifiers (QPNs) opaque to IPsec could allow injection attacks bypassing protections. This reveals fundamental protocol design gaps where security wasn't primary. Future protocol development, like Ultra Ethernet Consortium efforts, must incorporate authenticated, tenant-aware congestion control from inception.

### Architectural Solutions: Hardware-Assisted Performance Isolation and Rate Limiting

Mitigating sophisticated QP-based performance hacking requires architectural approaches—they exploit RNIC resource allocation models.

**Hardware-Assisted Isolation**: The "Harmonic" system from recent USENIX research offers state-of-the-art solutions. Programmable, intelligent PCIe switches between host CPUs and RNICs, combined with RDMA-aware rate limiters, monitor and modulate per-tenant RNIC resource use. This provides true performance isolation conscious of RNIC internal microarchitecture, preventing tenants from creating excessive QPs or abusing line-rate start features.

**Policy-Based Throttling**: Snyder proposes new congestion control algorithm weighting schemes. These dynamically decrease aggregate bandwidth for users opening excessive QPs. This directly disincentivizes and mitigates Parallel QP attacks—more connections don't yield greater bandwidth shares.

### The Importance of Advanced Fabric Telemetry and Anomaly Detection

Comprehensive fabric visibility remains critical regardless of preventative measures. Your AI fabric management platforms must provide deep telemetry and monitoring detecting attack signatures real-time. Key per-port and per-tenant metrics for continuous monitoring:

- PFC pause frame counts per priority
- ECN CE marking rates
- CNP generation and reception rates
- Active QPs per host or tenant

Sudden, anomalous metric spikes indicate ongoing attacks. Feeding telemetry into AIOps platforms establishes normal behavioral baselines. Anomaly detection algorithms flag suspicious activity warranting investigation.

## Table 2: Mitigation Strategies and Their Efficacy

| Mitigation Strategy | Targeted Attack(s) | Mechanism | Efficacy & Limitations |

|--------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|

| PFC Watchdog | PFC Storm | Detects persistently stalled queues, disables PFC, drops packets | High Efficacy: Prevents fabric-wide DoS. Limitation: Reactive; sacrifices lossless guarantee |

| IPsec for CNPs | CNP Forgery, ECN Bit Forgery | Provides cryptographic integrity and authentication for CNP-carrying IP packets | Potentially Effective: Prevents simple spoofing. Limitation: High performance overhead; sophisticated injection may bypass |

| Per-Tenant QP Limiting | Parallel QP Attack | Administrative policy enforced by hypervisor or RNIC driver limiting maximum tenant QPs | Effective for Parallel QP: Prevents QP flooding resource monopolization. Limitation: Doesn't prevent Staggered QP |

| Hardware-Assisted Rate Limiting | Parallel & Staggered QP | Intelligent PCIe switch monitors and enforces per-tenant RNIC rate limits and resource use | State-of-the-Art: Robust, microarchitecture-aware performance isolation. Limitation: Requires new, specialized server hardware |

| Advanced Telemetry & Anomaly Detection | All Attack Vectors | Statistical fabric telemetry analysis detecting baseline behavior deviations | Detection, not Prevention: Alerts operators to ongoing attacks. Limitation: Reactive; effectiveness depends on baseline quality and attack subtlety |

## Conclusion: Towards a Resilient and Secure AI Fabric

This analysis demonstrates conclusively that congestion control mechanisms essential to modern AI fabric performance constitute significant, practical attack surfaces. Pursuing extreme performance through RoCEv2 led to design choices—kernel bypass, unauthenticated control packets, per-connection rate limiting—readily exploitable in untrusted, multi-tenant environments. Resulting vulnerabilities cause catastrophic DoS, subtle performance degradation, and complete resource fairness breakdown. Malicious actors monopolize shared infrastructure.

This reality necessitates paradigm shifts in AI fabric design and security. Traditional boundaries between performance management and security dissolved. Performance isolation failure equals security breach. Security can't be perimeter firewall afterthoughts. It must be foundational, co-designed with fabric performance characteristics.

Secure, high-performance AI networking's future requires architectures that are fast, verifiably fair, and resilient. Move beyond reactive PFC watchdogs toward proactive, architectural solutions. Future standards from Ultra Ethernet Consortium must prioritize robust, authenticated, tenant-aware congestion control from inception. Building next-generation AI fabrics on security foundations ensures critical infrastructures support artificial intelligence's future without succumbing to sophisticated threats their complexity created.
